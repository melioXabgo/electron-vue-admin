# I Doser: A Digital Drug Experience with 172 Doses
 
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to experience the effects of different drugs without actually taking them? If so, you might be interested in I Doser, a software that claims to simulate various drug states using binaural beats. Binaural beats are sound waves that create a frequency difference between the left and right ear, which supposedly affects the brainwaves and induces altered states of consciousness.

I Doser offers 172 doses, ranging from common substances like alcohol, caffeine, marijuana, and LSD, to more exotic ones like ayahuasca, datura, krokodil, and spice melange. Each dose has a different duration, intensity, and description of its effects. Some doses are designed to enhance gaming performance, creativity, mood, or sleep quality. Others are meant to induce hallucinations, euphoria, sexual arousal, or even spiritual experiences.
 
To use I Doser, you need a pair of stereo headphones and a quiet environment. You can download the software from their website[^4^] or use their mobile app. You can also buy individual doses or packs of doses from their online store[^1^]. Once you have chosen a dose, you simply play it and relax. The dose will guide you through different stages of the drug experience, using sounds and visual cues.
 
But does I Doser really work? The answer depends on who you ask. Some users swear by it and report vivid sensations and realistic effects. Others say it is a hoax and a waste of time and money. There is not much scientific evidence to support or refute the claims of I Doser. Some studies have shown that binaural beats can affect brain activity and cognition, but not necessarily in the same way as drugs. Moreover, the effects of I Doser may vary depending on the individual's expectations, beliefs, personality, and mood.
 
Therefore, if you are curious about I Doser, you might want to try it for yourself and see what happens. However, be aware that I Doser is not a substitute for real drugs and it may have some risks. Some doses may cause unpleasant side effects like headaches, nausea, anxiety, or paranoia. Some doses may also trigger latent mental disorders or interfere with medication. And some doses may be illegal in some countries or violate the terms of service of some platforms.
 
So before you dive into the digital drug world of I Doser, make sure you do your research and use it responsibly. And remember: I Doser is for entertainment purposes only and should not be taken seriously as a medical or therapeutic tool.
  
So, what do users say about I-Doser? There are many reviews and testimonials online, both positive and negative, from people who have tried various doses. Some users report feeling relaxed, happy, energized, creative, or sleepy after listening to certain doses. Some even claim to have had out-of-body experiences, lucid dreams, or visions. Others say they felt nothing at all, or worse, they felt sick, dizzy, scared, or depressed. Some users also complain about the quality of the audio tracks, the price of the doses, or the difficulty of downloading them.
 
One way to get a glimpse of what I-Doser can do is to watch some of the videos on YouTube where people record their reactions to different doses. Some of these videos are hilarious, some are scary, and some are just plain boring. But they can give you an idea of what to expect and what not to expect from I-Doser. Here is an example of a video where a user tries the LSD dose[^3^]:

As you can see, the user seems to be having a good time and enjoying the dose. He says he feels like he is floating and seeing colors and patterns. He also says he feels euphoric and peaceful. However, he also admits that he is not sure if it is the dose or his own imagination that is causing these effects. He also says that he has never tried real LSD before, so he cannot compare the two experiences.
 
This brings us to the final question: is I-Doser worth it? The answer depends on your personal preferences, expectations, and goals. If you are looking for a fun and harmless way to experiment with different states of mind, I-Doser might be a good option for you. You might find some doses that work for you and help you achieve your desired effects. You might also discover new things about yourself and your potential.
 
However, if you are looking for a serious and reliable way to improve your health, well-being, or performance, I-Doser might not be the best choice for you. You might be disappointed by the lack of consistency, quality, or evidence behind the doses. You might also be better off using other methods that have more scientific support and proven benefits.
 
In conclusion, I-Doser is a fascinating and controversial phenomenon that has attracted millions of users around the world. It offers 172 doses that claim to simulate various drug states using binaural beats. Some users swear by it and report amazing effects. Others say it is a scam and a placebo. The truth is probably somewhere in between. I-Doser is not a magic bullet that can solve all your problems or give you all your dreams. But it is also not a dangerous or illegal product that can harm you or get you in trouble. It is simply a tool that can help you explore your own mind and have some fun along the way.
