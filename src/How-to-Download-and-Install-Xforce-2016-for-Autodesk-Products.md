## How to Use AutoCAD Mechanical 2016
 
AutoCAD Mechanical 2016 is a software that allows you to create and edit mechanical drawings and designs. It has many features and tools that can help you improve your productivity and accuracy. In this section, I will show you some basic steps to use AutoCAD Mechanical 2016.
 
### Step 1: Create a new drawing
 
To create a new drawing, you can either start from scratch or use a template. A template is a drawing file that contains predefined settings and objects that you can use as a base for your drawing. You can choose from the default templates provided by AutoCAD Mechanical or create your own custom templates.
 
To create a new drawing from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Click on File menu and select New.
2. In the Select Template dialog box, choose acad.dwt as the template file and click Open.
3. In the Drawing Units dialog box, choose the units and precision for your drawing and click OK.
4. A blank drawing area will appear. You can start drawing your mechanical parts and assemblies.

To create a new drawing from a template, follow these steps:

1. Click on File menu and select New.
2. In the Select Template dialog box, browse to the folder where the template files are stored and choose the template file that suits your needs. For example, you can choose AM\_METRIC.dwt for a metric drawing with AutoCAD Mechanical standards.
3. Click Open. A drawing area with predefined settings and objects will appear. You can modify or delete the existing objects or add new ones as needed.

### Step 2: Draw mechanical objects
 
To draw mechanical objects, you can use the commands and tools available in AutoCAD Mechanical. You can access them from the ribbon, the toolbars, the menus or the command line. Some of the common commands and tools are:

- Line: Draws straight line segments.
- Arc: Draws circular arcs.
- Circle: Draws circles.

- Text: Adds single-line or multi-line text to your drawing.
- Mtext: Adds multi-line text with formatting options to your drawing.
- Block: Creates or inserts a named collection of objects that can be reused in your drawing.
- Xref: Attaches an external reference file to your drawing.
- Layer: Manages the layers in your drawing. Layers are used to organize and control the visibility of objects in your drawing.
- Property: Changes the properties of selected objects such as color, linetype, lineweight, etc.

You can also use some of the specialized tools provided by AutoCAD Mechanical to draw mechanical objects such as:

- Gear: Draws gears with different types and parameters.
- Cam: Draws cams with different profiles and parameters.
- Screw: Draws screws with different standards and parameters.
- Nut: Draws nuts with different standards and parameters.
